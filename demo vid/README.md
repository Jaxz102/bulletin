## Bulletin - Hack at Home 2

[Bulletin Logo](Bullitin.jpg)

## Inspiration
In light of the pandemic, we decided an application that is rooted in community and people would be very useful, especially given that social interaction is severely limited. We believe our idea will allow student/workers/families to destress by getting involved with their community

## What it does
This web application displays important events that occur in the community with relevant information for the user to see and interact with. Users are also able to propose community events by filling the form in the "Add an Event" webpage. Proposed events will get stored in a separate database, where the admin will have to approve of the event before being shown in the "official"/public bulletin board (home page)

## How we built it
We used python, in particular, flask for the backend. For the front end portion, we used html5 and css3 to appropriately style the website with a particular visual standard in mind

## Challenges we ran into
Working with 2 databases was extremely hard especially because we constantly had to sort out the data (for our drop-down filter). We also faced the challenge of using the datetime module. We needed a method for the user input to be converted into a DateTime object, a method to sort our dataset based on DateTime comparisons, and a method to convert DateTime objects to string for the end-user

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were able to make the website fully functional for a user, as well as in a short period of time, being adequate with frameworks that would work in our project

## What we learned
We learned to better effectively work as a team together, to help each other out, and to collaborate on figuring out the best ideas to implement and use. We also dabbled with git actions and GitHub in general. We also got better at working with different object types and learned more about flask, a back-end framework that is based in Python.

## What's next for Bulletin
We hope to make more tools for the admin user to work with and use Google Maps API to show where each event is located. We also hope to integrate Bulletin with calendars so users can save events on their personal calendars. (We tried doing both but got stuck  ͡ಥ ͜ʖ ͡ಥ  )
